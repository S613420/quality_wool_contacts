## 🎯 Next Steps to Go Live

### 1. Add Firebase Service Account Secret
You need to add one more GitHub secret for Firebase deployment:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project → Project Settings → Service accounts
3. Click "Generate new private key"
4. Copy the entire JSON content
5. Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
6. Add a new secret named `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
7. Paste the entire JSON content as the value

### 2. Deploy Your App
Once the secret is added, deploy by either:

**Option A: Push to main branch**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Set up CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Manual deployment**
1. Go to GitHub → Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy to Firebase Hosting" 
3. Click "Run workflow"

### 3. Your Live URLs
After deployment, your app will be available at:

- **Firebase Hosting**: `https://your-project-id.web.app`
- **GitHub Pages**: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

## 🔍 Monitoring Your Deployment
