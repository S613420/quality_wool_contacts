## 🎯 What Your AI Assistant Needs to Complete

### **1. Update GitHub Actions Workflow**

The workflow needs to be updated to support both `main` and `develop` branches. Here's what to modify in `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml`:

#### **Update Trigger Section:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

#### **Update Deployment Step:**
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting
  run: |
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/firebase-service-account.json
    
    if [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/main" ]]; then
      echo "🏭 Deploying to Production"
      firebase target:apply hosting production ${{ secrets.VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID }}
      firebase deploy --only hosting:production --project ${{ secrets.VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID }}
      echo "✅ Production deployed: https://${{ secrets.VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID }}.web.app"
    elif [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/develop" ]]; then
      echo "🧪 Deploying to Development" 
      firebase target:apply hosting development ${{ secrets.VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID }}-dev
      firebase deploy --only hosting:development --project ${{ secrets.VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID }}
      echo "✅ Development deployed: https://${{ secrets.VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID }}-dev.web.app"
    fi
```

### **2. Configure Firebase Hosting Targets**

Run these commands in Firebase CLI or set up in Firebase Console:

```bash
# Set up production target (main branch)
firebase target:apply hosting production your-project-id

# Set up development target (develop branch)  
firebase target:apply hosting development your-project-id-dev
```

### **3. Test the Deployment**

After updating the workflow:

```bash
# Test development deployment
git checkout develop
git push origin develop
# Should deploy to: https://your-project-id-dev.web.app

# Test production deployment
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main  
# Should deploy to: https://your-project-id.web.app
```

## 🎪 Current Branch Status

### **Branches Available:**
- **`main`**: Production branch (needs dark mode merged)
- **`develop`**: Development branch (has dark mode + dual-site config)
- **`feature/dark-mode-toggle`**: Original feature branch (can be deleted after merge)

### **Recommended Deployment Flow:**
```bash
# 1. Merge dark mode to develop (already done)
git checkout develop  # ✅ Has dark mode + dual-site setup

# 2. Update workflow (AI assistant task)
# Modify .github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml

# 3. Test development deployment
git push origin develop
# → Should deploy to development site

# 4. When ready, deploy to production
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
# → Should deploy to production site
```

## 🌐 Expected URLs After Setup

### **Development Site (develop branch)**
- **URL**: `https://your-project-id-dev.web.app`
- **Purpose**: Public testing, development when away from home
- **Features**: Dark mode toggle, all latest features

### **Production Site (main branch)**  
- **URL**: `https://your-project-id.web.app`
- **Purpose**: Live production site for users
- **Features**: Stable, tested features only

## 🚀 Dark Mode Feature Status

The dark mode feature is **100% complete** and includes:
- ✅ **Light/Dark/System themes** with dropdown toggle
- ✅ **Smooth transitions** and animations
- ✅ **localStorage persistence** across sessions
- ✅ **System preference detection** and auto-switching
- ✅ **All components styled** for both themes
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** design
- ✅ **Accessibility compliant** with keyboard navigation

## 📋 Quick Task Summary for AI Assistant

1. **Update workflow file** to support develop branch deployment
2. **Configure Firebase hosting targets** (production + development)
3. **Test development deployment** by pushing to develop branch
4. **Deploy dark mode to production** when ready

The infrastructure is ready - just needs the workflow update to enable the dual-site deployment! 🎉
