# 🚨 CORRECTED: Fix Backend Configuration Issue

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The workflow is still using the old backend configuration:
```yaml
backend: quality-wool-contacts  # ❌ Wrong backend ID
```

This is why you're seeing "Backend Not Found" - the workflow isn't deploying to the correct backend IDs.

## 🔧 **EXACT Fix Required**

Your AI assistant needs to update **line 45** in `.github/workflows/firebase-app-hosting.yml`:

### **Current (Broken) Line 45:**
```yaml
backend: quality-wool-contacts  # Your backend ID
```

### **Replace with (Fixed):**
```yaml
backend: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'zidov-net' || 'zidov-net-dev' }}
```

## 📋 **Complete Updated Workflow Section**

Replace the entire deployment step with:

```yaml
      - name: Deploy to Firebase App Hosting
        uses: FirebaseExtended/action-app-hosting-deploy@v0
        with:
          serviceAccount: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}
          projectId: ${{ secrets.VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID }}
          backend: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'zidov-net' || 'zidov-net-dev' }}
        
      - name: Display deployment info
        run: |
          if [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/main" ]]; then
            echo "🏭 Production deployed to: https://quality-wool-contacts--zidov-net.asia-east1.hosted.app"
          else
            echo "🧪 Development deployed to: https://quality-wool-contacts--zidov-net-dev.asia-east1.hosted.app"
          fi
```

## 🌐 **Correct URLs After Fix**

- **Production** (main branch): `https://quality-wool-contacts--zidov-net.asia-east1.hosted.app`
- **Development** (develop branch): `https://quality-wool-contacts--zidov-net-dev.asia-east1.hosted.app`

## ⚡ **What This Fixes**

### **Before:**
- ❌ All deployments go to `quality-wool-contacts` backend
- ❌ Development site shows "Backend Not Found"
- ❌ Only production URL works

### **After:**
- ✅ **Main branch** → deploys to `zidov-net` backend  
- ✅ **Develop branch** → deploys to `zidov-net-dev` backend
- ✅ **Both URLs will work** after first deployment

## 🚀 **Immediate Steps**

1. **AI Assistant updates the workflow** with the exact code above
2. **Push to develop branch** to trigger deployment  
3. **Dark mode will be live** at: `https://quality-wool-contacts--zidov-net-dev.asia-east1.hosted.app`

## 🔍 **URL Format Note**

Make sure there are **no spaces** in the URL:
- ✅ `quality-wool-contacts--zidov-net-dev` (double dash)
- ❌ `quality-wool-contacts --zidov-net-dev` (space + dash)

The URL encoding issue you saw (`%20`) happens when there's a space in the URL. The correct format uses a double dash with no spaces.

## 🎯 **Quick Test**

After the fix is deployed, test both URLs:
- Production: `https://quality-wool-contacts--zidov-net.asia-east1.hosted.app`
- Development: `https://quality-wool-contacts--zidov-net-dev.asia-east1.hosted.app`

The development site will show your dark mode feature! 🌙✨
